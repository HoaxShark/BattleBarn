### Blog - Adrian
Hi, I'm Adrian, I'm a programmer and I mainly worked on implementing the different character shooting and ability mechanics. I also worked on the spawning system and made certain objects/obstacles destructible in the play space. Not knowing Unreal very well or C++ I was quite slow at implementing things at the beginning of the project and as a result ended up mainly using blueprints to program the majority of the game. As the project progressed, I became more confident with Unreal and blueprints so managed to implement the majority of what the designers requested, even using C++ - in an albeit limited way - for some parts of the character mechanics. All in all I have learned a lot from this project and hope to improve upon my perhaps inefficienct programming techiques in future projects.

Hello, I'm another programmer, I worked on generating a UI with the main menu and the in game UI and helped with ability mechanics, unfortunately a lot of what I did at the start of the project didn't make it into the main game, I felt as though even though I had never worked with unreal I had been very productive at the start of the project, however due to some mistakes with version control and working on seperate builds much of what I had done at the start of the project never made it into the game. In my next project I feel as though I need to keep up my enthusiasm and work ethic throughout the project. I think in the next game I would enjoy working in C++ much more as I understand how C++ works with unreal much better. I have to commend Adrian for helping out and doing a substantial amount of the game.
