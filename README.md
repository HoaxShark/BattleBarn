### Blog - Adrian
Hi, I'm Adrian, I'm a programmer and I mainly worked on implementing the different character shooting and ability mechanics. I also worked on the spawning system and made certain objects/obstacles destructible in the play space. Not knowing Unreal very well or C++ I was quite slow at implementing things at the beginning of the project and as a result ended up mainly using blueprints to program the majority of the game. As the project progressed, I became more confident with Unreal and blueprints so managed to implement the majority of what the designers requested, even using C++ - in an albeit limited way - for some parts of the character mechanics. All in all I have learned a lot from this project and hope to improve upon my perhaps inefficienct programming techiques in future projects.
